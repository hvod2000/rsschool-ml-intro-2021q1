That only means NO LINEAR relationship between them. Suppose we have variables x and y connected by a sinusoidal law $y=sin(x)$. There is obvious no linear relationship between them (for $x \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ y increases unevenly ant later for $x \\in [\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi]$ y decreases unevenly).
